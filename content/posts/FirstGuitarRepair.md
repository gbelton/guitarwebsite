## My first real guitar

I first learned to play guitar on a Silvertone acoustic that my brother got for Christmas when I was seven. I had a few guitars over the years, and then for many years I had none. In 2012, I went to guitar center and came home with this Fender T-Bucket. I paid $250 for it, so it's clearly not a great guitar, but I liked the way it felt in my hands and the way it sounded. I still do.

## It's broken!

In June of 2020, the bridge had started to lift from the top of the guitar.

I contacted a local luthier, and the results were what I expected: he told me the cost of the repair would be more than I had paid to buy it in the first place. 

# I can fix it

I had some basic woodworking tools and some basic skills to go with them. I figured I had nothing to lose. The guitar was not playable with the loose bridge. If the guitar was dead, my attempts to resurrect it couldn't possibly make it any worse!

I started by Googling "acoustic guitar bridge repair" and eventually found this video:

This video convinced me that I could do this repair. It also made me aware of the need to scrape away the old glue and the polyurethane under the bridge so I could get a good wood-to-wood bond.

I have since watched many hours of Jerry's videos, to the point where I feel like he is an old friend.

# It's fixed

I regret that I didn't take pictures to document the repair process. Here's a photo of the finished job:

It's certainly not perfect. On either side of the bridge you can see where the polyurethane flaked off. I filled it with tinted CA glue and sanded it as smooth as I could, but it still shows. That doesn't affect the playability, though. The guitar sounds as good as it ever did. 

I think it's not too bad, for my first attempt at lutherie. At least I kept my guitar out of the landfill!
