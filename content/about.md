I am not a professional luthier, just a guy with a cheap Harbor Freight workbench in the corner of his garage who likes to build and repair guitars. 

When I'm not working on guitars, I am a Business Intelligence Developer for the State Employees Health Plan. That means I spend a lot of time writing SQL code and building dashboards in Power Bi.

I'm also a part-time teacher. If you would like to know more, you can visit [my academic website](https://www.geraldbelton.com).
